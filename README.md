# Solving the Collatz Conjecture.
The Collatz Conjecture is a mathematical problem that has never been proven or disproven. The conjecture states that if you choose a number and follw the bwlow steps, you should end up in a loop 

if the number is even, divide it by 2, but if it is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. You keep doing this until you end up with 4. Once you get to 4, you should divide it by 2, then divide 2 by 2, which will give you 1. From there, you should multiply that by 3 and add 1, and then repeat the process all over again. This is the infanite loop.


This project aims to write some Python code that will attempt to brute force its way into finding a stopping point where this conjecture will be proven false or continue on forever and be proven true.
