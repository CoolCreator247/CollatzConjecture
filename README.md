# Solving the Collatz Conjecture.
The Collatz Conjecture is a math promlem That has never been proved or disapproved.
It states: Choose a random number; If it's even divide by 2,If it's odd multiply by 3 then add 1. At some point you will end up in an infinite loop; You keep doing this until you end up with 4.
When you get to the number four you would divide it by two and then divide two by two which you'd give you one.
Then multiply that by three and add one you go back to four and repeat the process all over.

This project is about writing some python code to try to brute force it into finding a stop where this will be proven false or continue on forever and be
proven true.
